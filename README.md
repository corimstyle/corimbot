# About
Corimbot is my personal Discord bot, with a collection of fun and funky-fresh commands.

Originally in JavaScript, Corimbot has been rewritten in Python to make my life easier.
Corimbot is deployed using [Heroku.](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Commands
All Corimbot commands use the "!corim" prefix:
* ping: Responds "Pong"
* win: Responds with "I see this as an absolute win!"
* thanos: Responds with a quote randomly selected from a list of quotes.
* flip: Corimbot will flip a coin.
* snap: Shuffles the list of guild members, then displays lists of "snapped" and "survivors."

# Other features
When an [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) profile is linked in a chat channel, Corimbot will display information about that user, such as their global ranking and hit accuracy.
